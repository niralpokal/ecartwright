    `Thanks for stopping by! I am a young account professional working and living my dream in Los Angeles, California. Born in Stoke-on-Trent, England, I came to America at 2 years old and therefore lack the neat accent. I was raised outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania next door to the mushroom farming capital of the world. I attended Penn State, double majoring in Advertising and Integrated Art with a focus on Design and Photography. I graduated in 2014 and made the cross country trek to LA in August of that year. 
    
    I have a passion for all things creative, especially in advertising. My desire to seek creativity, achieve excellence, learn quickly, and adapt to changing situations has led me to be a part of the national advertising team for one of the largest automotive companies in the US. I currently work on the Honda account at RPA and Iâ€™m so proud to collaborate with a company dedicated to imagination, dreams, and people. I love great work and I am inspired every day. 
    
    Outside of advertising, I find happiness in my cat (Grace Kelly of Meownaco), weekend trips, trying out random hobbies (whittling, long boarding, and watercolor to name a few), Reddit, and watching YouTube.
